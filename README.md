The document outlines the requirements and guidelines for a final project in an Object-Oriented Programming course at McGill University, focusing on the design and implementation of a modular Java application based on real-world scenarios.


Final Project Overview and Purpose
This project requires the development of a modular Java application using object-oriented programming principles. ​

Teams of 3–4 will design a console-menu-driven application based on one of five scenarios.
The project integrates skills from Modules 1–13, focusing on structured programming, data structures, and error handling. ​

Project Requirements and Features
The application must demonstrate various programming techniques and features.

Must include abstract classes, interfaces, inheritance, and polymorphism. ​
Requires composition for managing complex entities and encapsulation through private attributes. ​
Must implement searching, sorting algorithms, and robust error handling. ​

Project Options and Scenarios
Five project scenarios are available for teams to choose from.

Options include Library Management, Online Store Management, Animal Shelter Management, School Management, and Vehicle Rental Management Systems.
Each scenario has specific tasks and enhancement features to implement.

Class Design and UML Diagrams
The project requires a clear class design and UML diagrams to illustrate relationships. ​

Teams must create UML diagrams showing abstract classes, interfaces, and composition.
Diagrams should indicate methods and attributes for clarity.

Implementation and Testing Plan
A structured implementation and testing plan is essential for project success.

Code should be organized into packages for model, service, exceptions, and UI.
Testing scenarios must cover major features, including edge cases and exception handling. ​

Teamwork and Collaboration Guidelines
Effective collaboration is crucial for project completion and evaluation. ​

Teams must document planning, task division, and problem-solving processes. ​
Peer evaluations will assess individual contributions to ensure fair recognition. ​

Submission Format and Requirements
The final project must be submitted in a specific format to ensure completeness.

Submissions should include source code, project diagrams, reports, test cases, and any relevant documentation.
All files must be organized and compressed into a single archive for submission. ​
